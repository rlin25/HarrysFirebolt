# LAW 2: CREATE PLANNING DOCUMENTS

## Purpose
This prompt grader, HarrysFirebolt, is a tool for sweeping away all doubts about whether a given prompt is too ambiguous or insufficiently detailed. As such, it must be slightly demanding in terms of what it requires users to input.

## Requirements

### 1. Objective Outline
- Users must outline the objective of each prompt
- Format example: "I wish to add X feature in order to achieve Y result"
- The system must be flexible in parsing different user phrasing styles
- Both the feature (X) and the outcome (Y) must be clearly defined

### 2. Task List Management
- Task lists can be either:
  - Provided by the user
  - Generated by HarrysFirebolt and validated by the user
- Each task must be explicitly checked off by the user
- Large objectives must be broken down into smaller tasks
- Task hierarchy follows Jira structure:
  - Epic: Major feature or goal
  - Story: User-focused functionality
  - Task: Specific implementation step
  - Subtask: Detailed action item

### 3. Display Requirements
- Task lists and outlines must be displayed in an in-window pop-up
- Timelines should be displayed for each level:
  - Epic timelines
  - Story timelines
  - Task timelines
  - Subtask timelines
- Timelines should provide general duration estimates

## Important Notes
- The system must be flexible in accepting different user input styles
- All tasks must be validated by the user
- Task breakdown should be as detailed as possible
- Timeline estimates should be provided when possible
- The pop-up display should be clear and easy to navigate
