# LAW 1: CLARIFY ALL REQUIREMENTS

## Purpose
This tool evaluates prompts intended for AI coding assistants (like Cursor AI) by thoroughly analyzing each input for potential ambiguities, assumptions, and implementation challenges, ensuring that every aspect of the request is completely understood and verified before any implementation begins.

## Process

### 1. Input Analysis
- Every prompt is thoroughly analyzed for any potential ambiguity, including unclear requirements, undefined terms, or implicit assumptions that could lead to misinterpretation or incorrect implementation.

### 2. Two-Part Output

#### Assumptions Section
- A comprehensive list of all facts, conditions, and prerequisites that are assumed to be true for the successful implementation of the prompt
- Each assumption must be explicitly verified by the user before proceeding

#### Clarifications Section
- A detailed set of questions addressing implementation specifics
- Alternative approaches with their respective advantages and disadvantages
- The necessity of each requirement in the broader context
- Potential scope issues that could impact the project's success

### 3. Time Requirement
- A minimum review time of 10 minutes is required to ensure thorough analysis
- Time may extend based on:
  - Complexity of clarifications needed
  - Number of assumptions to verify
  - Depth of analysis required
  - User's response quality

### 4. Success Criteria
The prompt can only proceed to the planning phase when:
- All assumptions have been explicitly verified
- All clarifying questions have been satisfactorily answered
- No ambiguity remains in any aspect of the requirements
- User has confirmed their complete understanding of the implications

## Important Notes
- This tool operates as a standalone website focused solely on prompt quality evaluation
- No actual integration with Cursor AI or other external systems
- Primary focus is on thorough questioning and analysis of each prompt
- Strong emphasis on identifying and resolving potential ambiguities or assumptions
- No implementation work can begin until every aspect is thoroughly clarified and verified
