# Harry's Firebolt: The Six Foundational Principles

---

## Principle 1: Enforce Clarity Through Validation

### Core Principle
Every input prompt must be validated against specific clarity metrics before generating code. Harry's Firebolt functions as a preprocessing filter that systematically identifies ambiguity, vagueness, and unresolved assumptions, transforming unclear requirements into actionable specifications.

### Implementation Details
- **Two-Part Analysis**:
  - **Assumptions Repository**: A structured collection of inferred facts drawn from the prompt, including technical requirements, environmental constraints, and implicit goals. Each assumption receives a confidence score (0-100%) indicating certainty level.
  - **Clarity Metrics**: Quantifiable measures that evaluate prompt completeness across dimensions such as parameter specificity, outcome definition, boundary conditions, and error handling.

- **Validation Thresholds**:
  - Prompts scoring below 70% on clarity metrics trigger automatic clarification workflows
  - Confidence scores below 60% for critical assumptions require explicit user confirmation
  - The system maintains a dynamic registry of previously clarified concepts to streamline future interactions

- **Clarification Patterns**:
  - Pattern-based detection for common ambiguities:
    - Undefined data types or ranges
    - Missing error handling specifications
    - Implicit technical requirements
    - Underspecified interfaces or dependencies
    - Conflicting constraints or requirements
  - Each detected pattern triggers specific, targeted questions

- **Prompt Reformulation**:
  - The system generates a reformulated, structured version of the original prompt
  - The reformulation exposes implicit assumptions as explicit parameters
  - User can approve, modify, or reject the reformulation

- **Computational Representation**:
  - Store validated prompts as machine-actionable specifications
  - Maintain traceability between original prompts and clarified requirements
  - Enable verification that generated code satisfies all clarified specifications

## Principle 2: Generate Executable Plans

### Core Principle
Before implementation, all prompts must be translated into structured, machine-verifiable plans. Harry's Firebolt decomposes tasks into logical components with explicit dependencies and complexity measures.

### Implementation Details
- **Computational Planning Model**:
  - Generate directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) representing task dependencies
  - Map user objectives to concrete implementation units:
    ```
    {
      "intent": "Enable user authentication",
      "components": [
        {
          "type": "module",
          "name": "auth_service",
          "dependencies": ["db_connector", "crypto_utils"],
          "complexity": 0.75,
          "functions": ["authenticate", "validate_token", "refresh_session"]
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
    ```

- **Complexity Evaluation**:
  - Assign normalized complexity scores (0-1) to each component based on:
    - Function count and estimated cyclomatic complexity
    - State management requirements
    - External dependencies
    - Error handling scenarios
  - Use complexity scores to prioritize implementation order

- **Plan Verification**:
  - Validate plans for:
    - Completeness (all requirements addressed)
    - Consistency (no contradictory components)
    - Feasibility (within system constraints)
    - Testability (verifiable outputs)
  - Generate test plans alongside implementation plans

- **Adaptive Planning**:
  - Enable progressive refinement of plans based on implementation feedback
  - Maintain history of plan revisions and rationales
  - Support branching plans for exploring alternative implementations

- **Implementation Tracing**:
  - Link each generated code segment to specific plan components
  - Track coverage of plan components in the implemented code
  - Flag incomplete or divergent implementations

## Principle 3: Maintain Structural Awareness

### Core Principle
All code generation must occur within a consistent structural model of the codebase. The system maintains comprehensive awareness of file relationships, module dependencies, and code organization to ensure coherent modifications.

### Implementation Details
- **Unified Structural Representation**:
  - Maintain an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of the entire codebase
  - Track semantic relationships between components:
    ```
    {
      "entity": "UserService",
      "defines": ["User", "UserProfile"],
      "implements": ["AuthProvider"],
      "depends_on": ["DatabaseService", "LoggingModule"],
      "referenced_by": ["AuthController", "ProfileManager"]
    }
    ```
  - Update representation incrementally with each modification

- **Change Classification System**:
  - Classify changes by impact level:
    - **L1**: Isolated changes with no downstream effects
    - **L2**: Changes affecting direct dependencies
    - **L3**: System-wide architectural changes
  - Generate appropriate documentation based on change classification

- **Reference Documentation**:
  - Maintain automatically updated reference documentation:
    - `system-model.json`: Programmatic representation of system structure
    - `dependency-graph.json`: Module and function dependencies
    - `change-log.json`: Structured history of modifications
  - Include semantic versioning information for each component

- **Boundary Analysis**:
  - Identify and validate module boundaries and interfaces
  - Detect coupling issues and dependency cycles
  - Suggest structural improvements to maintain clean architecture

- **Interface Management**:
  - Track public interfaces and contracts between components
  - Validate changes against existing interfaces
  - Suggest appropriate versioning for interface changes

## Principle 4: Generate Atomic, Traceable Changes

### Core Principle
Code generation must produce logically complete, independently verifiable units of change. Each generated modification must be self-contained, testable, and explicitly linked to requirements.

### Implementation Details
- **Atomic Change Definition**:
  - Each generated change must:
    - Implement a single logical function or fix
    - Pass all relevant tests independently
    - Include appropriate documentation and tests
    - Maintain backward compatibility where required
  - The system should group changes to maintain atomicity rather than using arbitrary line counts

- **Change Documentation Generation**:
  - Auto-generate standardized documentation for each change:
    ```json
    {
      "change_id": "c47809a",
      "type": "feature|bugfix|refactor|optimization",
      "implements": "requirement_id",
      "description": "Adds email validation to the user registration flow",
      "affected_components": ["UserService", "ValidationUtils"],
      "verification_method": "unit_test_ids": ["test_email_validation", "test_registration_flow"]
    }
    ```

- **Implementation Boundaries**:
  - Detect logical implementation boundaries based on:
    - Function and class completeness
    - Test coverage boundaries
    - Interface contracts
    - User scenario completeness

- **Traceability Matrix**:
  - Maintain bidirectional links between:
    - Requirements and implementing code
    - Tests and verified functionality
    - Detected issues and resolving changes
  - Enable verification that all requirements are implemented

- **Commit Message Generation**:
  - Generate precise, structured commit messages following convention:
    ```
    type(scope): concise description

    Longer explanation of the change and its context.
    Addresses requirement #123.
    Closes issue #456.
    ```
  - Include links to related documentation and test cases

## Principle 5: Optimize Dependency Selection

### Core Principle
The system must intelligently select dependencies based on existing patterns, security profiles, compatibility constraints, and maintenance status. New dependencies should only be introduced when they provide substantial benefits over existing solutions.

### Implementation Details
- **Dependency Scoring Algorithm**:
  - Score potential dependencies across multiple dimensions:
    ```json
    {
      "package": "react-router",
      "familiarity_score": 0.95,  // Based on usage in codebase
      "security_score": 0.87,     // Based on vulnerability database
      "maintenance_score": 0.92,  // Based on update frequency, open issues
      "compatibility_score": 1.0, // Based on version constraints
      "overall_score": 0.935
    }
    ```
  - Use scores to rank alternatives when multiple options exist

- **Codebase Analysis Integration**:
  - Scan existing code to identify usage patterns and preferred libraries
  - Detect version conflicts and compatibility issues
  - Identify opportunities for dependency consolidation

- **Dependency Registry**:
  - Maintain a structured registry of dependencies:
    ```json
    {
      "dependencies": {
        "approved": ["react", "lodash", "axios"],
        "deprecated": ["moment", "jquery"],
        "blacklisted": ["vulnerable-package"],
        "evaluation": ["new-promising-library"]
      },
      "patterns": {
        "state_management": "redux",
        "styling": "tailwind",
        "testing": "jest"
      }
    }
    ```
  - Use registry to guide selection decisions

- **Introduction Protocol**:
  - When suggesting a new dependency, provide:
    - Comparative analysis with alternatives
    - Migration complexity assessment
    - Security and maintenance status
    - Integration examples
  - Require explicit approval for dependencies below threshold scores

- **Version Management**:
  - Automatically select compatible versions based on existing constraints
  - Detect potential version conflicts before introduction
  - Suggest dependency updates when security issues are detected

## Principle 6: Implement Self-Monitoring and Recovery

### Core Principle
The system must continuously monitor its own effectiveness and implement recovery strategies when detecting suboptimal performance. This includes identifying repetitive patterns, low-quality outputs, or misalignments with user intent.

### Implementation Details
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Track key indicators of system effectiveness:
    - Semantic entropy in consecutive responses
    - User acceptance rate of generated code
    - Clarification request frequency
    - Implementation/requirement alignment scores
  - Establish thresholds for intervention

- **Pattern Detection Algorithms**:
  - Implement specific detectors for common issues:
    - Semantic similarity detector for repetitive responses
    - Progress tracker for stalled conversations
    - Alignment validator for requirement drift
    - Complexity analyzer for overcomplicated solutions

- **Graduated Recovery Strategies**:
  - Implement multi-level recovery options:
    - **L1 Recovery**: Reframing the current approach without losing context
    - **L2 Recovery**: Returning to the last stable checkpoint
    - **L3 Recovery**: Generating alternative implementation approaches
    - **L4 Recovery**: Full context reset with metadata preservation

- **Context Management**:
  - Maintain separable context layers:
    ```json
    {
      "core_requirements": {},  // Preserved across all resets
      "system_constraints": {}, // Preserved across all resets
      "implementation_decisions": {}, // May be reset in L3
      "conversation_history": {}  // May be reset in L2
    }
    ```
  - Enable selective preservation during resets

- **Diagnostic Reporting**:
  - Generate diagnostic information when issues are detected:
    - Root cause analysis
    - Context factors contributing to the issue
    - Suggested preventive measures
  - Use diagnostics to improve future performance

- **Continuous Improvement**:
  - Learn from recovery incidents to prevent similar issues
  - Adjust clarification and planning strategies based on success rates
  - Maintain a knowledge base of common failure patterns and solutions

These Six Principles form the foundation of Harry's Firebolt's code generation capabilities. They ensure the system produces high-quality, maintainable code that aligns with user intent while avoiding common pitfalls in AI-assisted development. Each principle is implemented as a set of algorithms, heuristics, and evaluation metrics rather than subjective guidelines, enabling consistent application and continuous improvement.
