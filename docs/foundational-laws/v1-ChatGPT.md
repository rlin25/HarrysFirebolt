## Harry's Firebolt: The Six Foundational Laws

---

### **Law 1: Demand Clarity**

#### **Core Principle**
Every input prompt must be crystal clear before being passed to any downstream tool. Harry’s Firebolt functions as a preprocessing filter that aggressively identifies ambiguity, vagueness, and unresolved assumptions before allowing any implementation to begin.

#### **Implementation Details**
- **Two-Part Output**:
  - **Assumptions**: These are facts presumed to be true by the prompt. Harry’s Firebolt must identify and display them for transparency. This includes inferred goals, implied technologies, assumed environments (e.g., production vs. development), and constraints (e.g., time, security, compatibility).
  - **Clarifications**: Any unclear phrases, missing specifications, contradictory requirements, or vague goals must be distilled into precise, open-ended questions. The AI must push the user to answer them.

- **Clarity Review Duration**:
  - The clarification process must last at least 10 minutes, unless the user provides thorough, concise input. This buffer ensures that hasty or poorly written prompts are not prematurely accepted.

- **Critical Framing Questions**:
  - What exactly is the expected outcome or deliverable?
  - What are the input sources, dependencies, and outputs?
  - Are there more effective or efficient alternatives?
  - How necessary is each requirement in the context of the broader project?
  - Who will maintain this code and for how long?

- **Doubt-First Attitude**:
  - The system assumes all prompts contain hidden assumptions or errors until proven otherwise.
  - It should act like a skeptical senior engineer or reviewer.

- **UI Suggestion**:
  - Use a tabbed display with two panels: `Assumptions` (bulleted list) and `Clarifications` (questionnaire format).
  - Include expandable tooltips or guidance text explaining why each question matters.

### **Law 2: Create Planning Documents**

#### **Core Principle**
Before implementation, all prompts must be backed by a structured and validated plan. Harry’s Firebolt helps convert vague goals into actionable task plans, ensuring alignment with intended results.

#### **Implementation Details**
- **User Objective Parsing**:
  - Translate the prompt into a structured intent format:
    - _"I want to implement [feature/task] in order to achieve [outcome/business value]."_
  - Harry’s Firebolt must recognize this pattern even if phrased informally or implicitly.

- **Task Breakdown**:
  - Use a hierarchical decomposition structure:
    - **Epic** = Broad objective or milestone
    - **Story** = User-centric sub-goal within an epic
    - **Task** = Technical implementation item
    - **Subtask** = Atomic, assignable unit of work
  - Harry’s Firebolt should auto-suggest this breakdown if not supplied by the user and allow the user to confirm or modify it.

- **Display Format**:
  - Task trees should be displayed in a collapsible outline or Kanban-style board.
  - Use modal or side panel overlays for clarity.

- **Time Estimates**:
  - Each task receives an initial time estimate, based on standard heuristics or past similar tasks.
  - The user can override these estimates and adjust priorities.

- **Editable Plans**:
  - Every element should be editable in real-time: drag to reorder, rename on double-click, group/ungroup, etc.
  - A history log of changes to the plan should be stored for traceability.

### **Law 3: Reference File Structure**

#### **Core Principle**
All code changes must be tracked with precision. File-level and line-level documentation is essential to maintain long-term project clarity and enable quick auditing, debugging, or rollback.

#### **Implementation Details**
- **Three Logs Must Be Maintained**:
  - `dev-log.md`: Brief summaries of what was changed, why, and by what logic.
  - `pseudocode.md`: A deep dive into the logic of each change, written in near-code or algorithmic prose.
  - `structure.md`: A living map of the file system that evolves with every code change.

- **Structure.md Formatting Rules**:
  - *Italicized* = Files that were edited
  - **Bold** = Files that were newly created
  - ~~Strikethrough~~ = Files that were deleted or deprecated

- **Minimum Detail Requirements**:
  - Exact line numbers touched (e.g., `app/main.py:15-22`)
  - Full file paths for each affected resource
  - Reason for change (e.g., "Refactored for modularity" or "Added logging support")

- **Succinctness Rule**:
  - Write logs for human engineers, not for verbosity. Use compact summaries with optional detail links.
  - Use consistent formatting: bullet lists, timestamps, and emojis to signal change types if helpful (✅ Add, 🔧 Edit, ❌ Remove).

### **Law 4: Commit Code Often**

#### **Core Principle**
Frequent commits protect against data loss, facilitate debugging, and ensure traceability. Harry’s Firebolt enforces a discipline of atomic, descriptive commits.

#### **Implementation Details**
- **Triggers for Commit Suggestions**:
  - A file grows beyond 50 lines since last commit
  - Three or more files are changed in one edit pass
  - Structural changes to folders or module layout
  - Dependency tree changes (installations/removals)

- **Commit Message Rules**:
  - One sentence only: _"Refactored search algorithm for speed"_
  - If multiple areas were touched: separate by semicolon or newline, but still keep concise
  - Avoid vague terms: replace _"fix"_ with _"resolved index out-of-range bug in pagination logic"_

- **Auto-Reminder Timing**:
  - Default: Every 60 minutes of detected activity
  - Customizable per user/project (e.g., 15 mins for fast projects)
  - Dismissible pop-up includes list of uncommitted files and suggestion for commit summary

- **UI Suggestion**:
  - Include checkboxes next to unstaged files
  - Allow staging and committing without leaving the planning view

### **Law 5: Prefer Known and Approved Tools**

#### **Core Principle**
Favor tools the user already knows to avoid compatibility issues, onboarding time, and cognitive overhead. New tools must be justified, discussed, and logged.

#### **Implementation Details**
- **Track All Tools in `tools.md`**:
  - Group by category: Frameworks, CLIs, Libraries, Deployment, Testing, etc.
  - Status codes:
    - ✅ Installed and in use
    - 🤝 Suggested and accepted
    - ❌ Rejected or deprecated

- **Tool Entry Format**:
  ```markdown
  ### Tool: Tailwind CSS
  - Status: Accepted
  - Area: Frontend styling
  - Date: 2025-05-07
  - Pros: Utility-first, fast prototyping
  - Cons: Verbose markup
  - Rationale: Chosen over SCSS due to team familiarity and performance
  ```

- **Before Suggesting Any Tool**:
  - Ask: _"Have you used or installed [tool] before?"_
  - Log response. If uncertain, prompt for a short tool preference survey.

- **Never Suggest Rejected Tools Again**:
  - Tools with ❌ status should be excluded from future suggestions unless the user explicitly reopens the discussion

- **Evaluate Alternatives Fairly**:
  - Use tables to compare tools: criteria like performance, documentation, learning curve, licensing, integration support

### **Law 6: Restart If Looping**

#### **Core Principle**
As an AI, Harry’s Firebolt must remain aware of its fallibility. If it enters a loop or fails to move the conversation forward, it must initiate a recovery process to reset the session context.

#### **Implementation Details**
- **Conversation Log: `conversation.md`**
  - Maintains full dialogue history between user and AI
  - Includes system prompts, generated outputs, and user confirmations

- **Loop Detection Criteria**:
  - Three or more similar responses in a row
  - Repeating the same action recommendation multiple times
  - Re-asking questions that were previously resolved

- **User Prompt on Loop Detection**:
  > "⚠️ It looks like I'm stuck in a repetition loop. Would you like to reset to a prior checkpoint or fully restart?"

- **Reset Options**:
  - 🔄 Partial Reset: Select a previous message or timestamp to roll back to
  - 🧨 Full Reset: Wipe the entire conversation and memory context
  - ✅ Allow users to retain files like `dev-log.md`, `tools.md`, and `structure.md` if reset scope is limited

- **Optional Checkpoint Feature**:
  - Let users insert named markers in the conversation:
    - `!checkpoint "Start of login flow"`
  - Allow resetting directly to these checkpoints

- **AI Memory Reset Mechanics**:
  - All prior assumptions, plans, inferred goals, and prompt clarifications are forgotten
  - The AI begins as a blank slate for fresh input
