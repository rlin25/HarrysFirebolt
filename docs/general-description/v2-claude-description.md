# Harry's Firebolt: Technical Project Description

## Executive Summary

**Harry's Firebolt** is a prompt engineering and validation system designed to integrate with Cursor AI IDE. It implements a systematic preprocessing pipeline that analyzes, restructures, and validates user prompts before they are processed by code generation models, resulting in higher-quality code output and reduced rework cycles.

## Technical Architecture

Harry's Firebolt operates as a middleware layer with the following components:

1. **Prompt Analysis Engine**: Parses natural language prompts using NLP techniques to identify:
   - Requirements and constraints
   - Implicit assumptions
   - Ambiguities and underspecified elements
   - Technical dependencies and environment expectations

2. **Validation Pipeline**: Processes prompts through sequential validation stages:
   - Semantic clarity scoring (0-100)
   - Ambiguity detection algorithms
   - Completeness verification against domain-specific heuristics
   - Contradiction and inconsistency detection

3. **Documentation Generator**: Automatically produces standardized documentation:
   - Structured requirements documents
   - Component/task breakdown trees
   - Dependency graphs and relationship maps
   - Change tracking manifests

4. **Implementation Monitor**: Tracks coding activity to ensure alignment with plans:
   - Code change detection and classification
   - Commit boundary identification
   - Progress tracking against planned components
   - Deviation alerts when implementation diverges from plans

5. **Feedback Integration System**: Processes user responses to improve future interactions:
   - Adaptation to user preferences and patterns
   - Refinement of clarity thresholds based on outcomes
   - Learning from successful/unsuccessful interactions
   - Personalization of interaction style

## Implementation of the Six Principles

Harry's Firebolt implements the six foundational principles through specific technical mechanisms:

### 1. Clarity Enforcement

### 5. Dependency Optimization

**Technical Implementation:**
- Analyzes existing codebase for technology patterns
- Scores potential dependencies on multiple dimensions
- Verifies compatibility with existing environment
- Checks security and maintenance status of packages

**User Interaction:**

### 6. Self-Monitoring Systems

**Technical Implementation:**
- Tracks interaction effectiveness metrics
- Implements pattern recognition for detecting repetitive loops
- Maintains separable context layers for graduated resets
- Generates diagnostics for system performance issues

**User Interaction:**
- Offers recovery options when issues are detected
- Provides transparency into system state and decisions
- Allows manual checkpoint creation and restoration
- Supports feedback submission for system improvement

## Technical Requirements

### System Requirements
- Node.js v16+ runtime environment
- 4GB+ RAM for NLP processing components
- WebSocket support for real-time interaction
- Local storage access for context persistence

### Integration Points
- **Cursor AI API**: REST interface for submitting processed prompts
- **Local Filesystem**: For code structure analysis and documentation
- **Optional Git Integration**: For commit suggestion implementation
- **Browser Storage**: For maintaining session context and preferences

### Performance Targets
- Prompt analysis completion in <2 seconds for standard requests
- Documentation generation in <5 seconds
- <100ms response time for interactive clarification flows
- Support for codebases up to 100,000 LOC without performance degradation

## Usage Workflow

1. **Initial Engagement**:
   - Developer enters natural language prompt in web interface
   - System performs initial analysis and clarity scoring
   - If clarity threshold is met, proceeds to planning; otherwise, initiates clarification dialogue

2. **Clarification Phase**:
   - System presents specific questions addressing detected ambiguities
   - Developer provides additional information or constraints
   - Process repeats until clarity threshold is achieved

3. **Planning Phase**:
   - System generates and displays implementation plan
   - Developer reviews and adjusts as needed
   - System creates necessary documentation files

4. **Implementation Phase**:
   - System forwards processed prompt to Cursor AI
   - Monitors generated code against planned components
   - Suggests commit points when logical units are completed

5. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Developer provides acceptance/rejection of results
   - System updates interaction models based on outcomes
   - Lessons learned are incorporated into future processing

## Differentiation from Existing Solutions

Unlike general prompt engineering tools, Harry's Firebolt:

1. **Integrates domain-specific knowledge** of software development practices
2. **Maintains ongoing project context** rather than treating each prompt as isolated
3. **Enforces structural consistency** across multiple generation sessions
4. **Provides concrete, measurable quality metrics** rather than general guidelines
5. **Adapts to individual and team development patterns** through usage analysis
