It implements a systematic preprocessing pipeline to analyze, refine, and validate natural language prompts, transforming potentially ambiguous requirements into structured, actionable specifications. This process significantly enhances the precision and relevance of input to code generation models, directly leading to demonstrably higher-quality code output, reduced manual rework cycles, and accelerated development velocity by preemptively addressing common sources of AI misunderstanding."
